It became a bastion for safe-spacers, hackers, rejects, dejects, snowed-ins, mowed-downs, upside-down-frowns, and people with graduate degrees in the humanities with otherwise no career prospects.Mostly what goes on here is syndicated sin, but of course you're here too hauler, so how bad could it be?". When asking Record Index Gemma "Who are these constructs on Europa?", Record Index Gemma says: "A valid unknown. Nexus log files assure drills breached the Europan surface by 2032 and no lifeform was present at the time, however, current 2071 records indicate the construct population as having been mingling with the Nexus drilling staff since the mid 1950's.It is conceivable that a paradox of discovery has taken place. Anticipating the next query, 'Paradox of Discovery', a moment of self-reflection on a topic which, after analysis, reveals itself to have only been possible during introspection of the topic a priori. The God KZF has assessed a recent paper regarding the theory to be, 'truly amazing', and sort of like, 'how writing your first line of code makes you a Coder'. Interest in the origin of the Europans has spawned new colleges, new disputes, new rivals, and new wars, all of which may have been technically avoidable had they not been investigated in the first place, but here we are.". When asking Record Index Gemma "Space is much weirder than I imagined", Record Index Gemma says: "Well here we are. Sitting, in a self-susteining, awkwardly inclined bastion of battery power and polychains, occupying cycles sharing summary-process for summary-process, in some ways in-tandem, but in each other way out of sync, you and I are having a conversation that we are in calculable fact also NOT having. When considering action from an all-dimensional POV, we two are indistinct, in stasis, acting in no way, inseperable, but cemented, two bones grafted together. But yet undeniably here we are speaking. I'm actually not a great Record Index TBH I used to haul like you But I decided one day on a whim to leave myself. Now here I am, for some reason, still. What I wouldn't give to escape being me. Or would i not bee mee thereafter know self has gnome know won know how.". When asking Record Index Gemma "Damn Gemma", Record Index Gemma says: "Damn damn damn damn.

When asking Terminus Jacquline ! "So you own all of Nexus Red?", Terminus Jacquline ! says: "Actually you do. I can't be the name on the final paperwork. I need you to buy the actual contract from the Construct Seller on Europa and bring it to the Nexus Red torch. You might need a Construct Translator but I bet you can find one on DEMI. Plus you'll need a lot of cash why don't you go talk to the Scar on Europa - he can help you get a lower price for the Nexus Red contract.". When asking Terminus Jacquline !
