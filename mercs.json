Torrent: Streamable database in which each byte iterates on the previous as compared to a hard copy in which each byte acts as a piece of a complete puzzle.Quasitorrent: Torrent which while streamable never completes due to the update rate of the underlying data, typically as a result of high ratio of source contributor updates vs data stream rate.Hash-Underpinned Quasitorrent: The above described Quasitorrent wherein data stream is continuously matched against hashed checksums of its <u>original</u> contributors. A HUQT is the most stable mass-summary identity interface known to our culture.
